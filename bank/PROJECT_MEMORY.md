# Project Memory — Go Microservices (Go-Microservices)

_Last updated: 2025-12-23_

This document is the canonical memory and orientation file for the Go-Microservices project. It is written for humans and automated agents (CI, bots) to quickly understand the codebase, design decisions, auth behavior, test harnesses, and operational commands.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Provide a compact but comprehensive summary of the project structure, responsibilities, critical flows (auth, payments, orders), and operational/testing pointers.
- Serve as a starting point / index for any agent or contributor onboarding to work on features, debugging, or automated maintenance.

---

## 🔧 High-level Architecture

- Language: Go (Gin framework) for microservices.
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router) under `client/`.
- Databases: PostgreSQL per service, plus a separate `auth-db` for users & sessions.
- Queue: RabbitMQ for async events.
- Cache: Redis (used by some services, e.g., order worker/cache).
- Local orchestration: `docker-compose.yml` for multi-service runs.

---

## 📁 Key Services (folders)

- `auth-service/` — central auth: register/login/refresh/logout/revoke/list-sessions. Stores user and session data.
- `api-gateway/` — entry point, validates JWTs and sets `X-User-Id` / `X-User-Roles` headers for downstream services.
- `order-service/`, `payment-service/`, `cart-service/`, `product-service/`, etc. — domain services implementing business logic with ownership checks.
- `client/` — Next.js app implementing App Router server routes for auth and a server-side proxy to forward requests with httpOnly cookies.

---

## 🔐 Auth & Security

- Access Token: JWT HS256, short-lived (e.g., 15m). Signed using `JWT_SECRET`.
- Refresh Token: Random token, long-lived (e.g., 7d), stored _hashed_ in `sessions` table; rotated on refresh (refresh token rotation) and revocable.
- Sessions: Stored in the `auth-db` with hashed refresh tokens, device info, IP, expiration.
- Logout & Revoke: Refresh tokens can be revoked (DELETE session); login returns access + refresh tokens.
- Gateway enforcement: API Gateway validates JWT and forwards user info via headers: `X-User-Id`, `X-User-Roles`.
- Frontend cookie handling: Server routes set httpOnly `access_token` and `refresh_token`, and a non-httpOnly `user` cookie for client UI display.

---

## 🔁 Token Flow (Summary)

1. Client POST `/api/auth/login` → server sets httpOnly `access_token` + `refresh_token` and returns user information.
2. Client includes `access_token` (via proxy) → API Gateway verifies JWT and forwards headers.
3. On 401 from internal services, server proxy attempts POST `/api/auth/refresh` (using server-side `refresh_token`) to rotate refresh token and retry the original request.
4. Logout/Revocation invalidates refresh token in DB.

## 📚 Important Files & Locations

- Auth service: `auth-service/controller/auth_controller.go`, `auth-service/model/*`, `auth-service/db/*`
- Gateway JWT helpers: `api-gateway/auth.go`
- Frontend App Router routes:
  - `client/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
  - `client/app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts`
  - `client/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`
  - `client/app/api/proxy/route.ts` (server-side proxy for forwarding requests)
- Client helpers: `client/lib/api.ts`, `client/server/lib/serverProxy.ts`
- Tests:
  - Unit tests: Go (`*_test.go`), client (`client/tests/` using Vitest)
  - Integration: `tests/integration/integration_test.go` (Docker Compose driven)
- CI: `.github/workflows/integration.yml` (integration test workflow)

---

## ✅ Testing & CI

- Unit tests use Go testing + `sqlmock` for DB-level tests.
- Frontend unit tests use Vitest in `client/`.
- Integration tests run a `docker-compose` environment and exercise register→login→create customer→add-to-cart→create-order→create-payment→confirm-payment flow.
- The integration job is gated by env variable e.g., `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true` to avoid running expensive tests unintentionally.

---

## ⚙️ Local Dev / Run

- Environment variables: check `.env` examples for `JWT_SECRET`, DB URLs, RABBITMQ, REDIS, STRIPE keys (optional stubbed mode when absent).
- Start locally (development):
  - `docker-compose up --build` — starts services and DBs
  - Or run services individually with `go run .` from each service folder with appropriate env vars.
- Client: `cd client` → `pnpm install` → `pnpm dev` (or `pnpm build` / `pnpm start`).

---

## 💡 Agent Guidance / How to use this memory file

- Use this file as the first reference for architecture and auth rules. If making edits that change auth flows, update this file to keep memory consistent.
- Before proposing CI or test changes, run unit tests locally and then the integration suite.
- When modifying App Router server routes, ensure `cookies()` is awaited and `cookieStore` is used (Next 13+ cookie API returns a Promise).
- When adding new services, register their Docker Compose service and appropriate DB container and add healthchecks.

## 🧠 Memory Context — Frontend Auth & Authorization (recent changes)

- Summary: Added UI-level auth and authorization guards using Next.js App Router group layouts and an Edge middleware to provide fast redirects and scoped role checks for the frontend. These are UX protections only: back-end services **must** continue verifying tokens and enforcing authorization.

- What changed (key files):

  - `client/app/(main)/layout.tsx` — Server-side group layout: reads `access_token` from cookies, decodes payload to check expiry and redirect to `/auth/login` for unauthenticated users.
  - `client/app/(main)/(admin)/layout.tsx` — Admin group layout: enforces `roles` include `admin`; redirects non-admins to `/unauthorized`.
  - `client/middleware.ts` — Edge middleware: matches `/admin/*`, `/customer/*`, `/order/*`, `/cart/*` and redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth/login` (preserves attempted path) and non-admins to `/unauthorized`.
  - `client/lib/decodeJwt.ts` — Lightweight JWT payload decoder used for UI checks (no signature verification).
  - `client/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` and `client/app/(auth)/logout/page.tsx` — Simple client pages for login/logout flows that interact with `api/auth/*` endpoints.
  - `client/app/unauthorized/page.tsx` — Simple UX page for unauthorized access.

- ESLint change: `client/eslint.config.mjs` sets `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` to `"warn"` to ease migration where `any` appears (warnings, not errors).

- Security note: The JWT decoding on the frontend is a convenience for UX (redirects, UI decisions). **Do not** rely on it for real access control — always verify the JWT signature and enforce scopes/roles on the server-side API/gateway.

- Tests & verification:

  - Add integration/e2e tests for the redirect / refresh behavior (visiting protected routes should redirect to login, admin route should return unauthorized for non-admins).
  - Local smoke test: `cd client && pnpm dev` → visit protected pages and verify redirects; use real auth-service endpoints or mock cookies for tests.

- How to extend:
  - To protect additional frontend routes, update the `matcher` in `client/middleware.ts` and/or add new group layouts that perform required checks.
  - To implement automatic token refresh on the frontend (rotation), add a server-side proxy refresh endpoint and a client retry mechanism in `client/app/api/proxy/route.ts`.

## 📌 Current State Snapshot (summary)

- Auth implemented (register/login/refresh/logout/revoke), session rotation in place.
- Gateway JWT validation + role headers present; critical routes protected (orders, payments, cart).
- Frontend proxy, auth server routes, and AutoRefreshClient implemented.
- Integration tests exist but may require `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true` and Docker available to run.

---

## 🧭 Next Recommended Improvements (short list)

- Add more negative-path tests for token rotation edge cases and concurrent refresh scenarios.
- Add an observability metric (Prometheus) for auth events: failed login, revoked sessions, refresh failures.
- Add automated updating workflow if this file is changed (e.g., validate presence & last-updated via CI lint step).

---

## ❓ Questions / Notes for maintainers

- Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is rotated carefully across environments; sessions in DB may need invalidation after rotation.
- Consider supporting asymmetric JWTs (RS256) for improved key rotation strategies in future.

If you'd like, I can split this memory into multiple files (architecture.md, auth.md, testing.md) or add links to the most important source files. Want me to commit this to `main` branch or open a PR?
